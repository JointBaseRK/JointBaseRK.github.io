<h1>Welcome to Our Blue and Red Team Blog! </h1>

<h3> Who are we?</h3>

Per our titles, we are a couple of senior SOC analysts working at one of the largest MSSPs in the US. Outside of our titles, we are friends cooperating to create a decently large repository of information for new, and experienced cybersecurity enthusiasts looking for detailed write-ups of red / blue team activity. 

<br>
On very few occassions within my professional career have I had coworkers willing to answer questions / assist on technical investigations or questions, and I am currently looking to bridge this gap within a small community -K

<h3> What kind of content should I expect to see?</h3>
<br>
The goal of this repository is to hack boxes, and also look at the IOCs from a blue team perspective in order to give the full idea of what a compromise may look like. Along with this goal, we would also like to present this information or set of findings to individuals that are curious about either side of the equation. Individuals that may find this set of data useful are as follows:
<br>
<br>

- A blue team operator curious about how a specific attack works
- A red team operator curious about footprints generated during an engagement
- An individual curious about the inner workings of cyber attack, defense, and response
- General cyber hobbyists / professionals


<br>


Below is a set of data for us to track the following:
- How many boxes have been owned on HTB
- How many write ups have been completed for the boxes completed on the prior bullet
- How many of the boxes have we created YouTube videos or Discord presentations for

what commands are used, what type of data is generated, and the sources of telemetry that can be used to triage a related incident.
